# Empathy Frameworks Reference

## User Persona Template

For each persona, capture:

```markdown
### Persona: [Name — e.g., "Busy Brenda"]

**Demographics & Context**
- Role/Title:
- Industry/Domain:
- Experience level:
- Technical proficiency:
- Key tools currently used:

**Behavioral Patterns**
- How they currently solve the problem:
- Frequency of the task/activity:
- Workarounds they employ:
- Decision-making style (data-driven, intuition, consensus):

**Goals & Motivations**
- Primary goal (what they're trying to achieve):
- Secondary goals:
- What success looks like to them:
- Career/personal motivations:

**Frustrations & Pain Points**
- Top 3 frustrations with current state:
- What they've tried that didn't work:
- Constraints they operate under:

**Quotes** (real or synthesized from research)
- "[Direct quote capturing their mindset]"
```

**Persona quality checklist:**
- Based on real data or validated assumptions, not fiction
- Specific enough to guide decisions (reject "everyone" personas)
- Includes behavioral patterns, not just demographics
- Captures emotional state and motivations
- Distinguishable from other personas (each has unique needs)

## Empathy Map Template

For each persona, map four quadrants:

```markdown
### Empathy Map: [Persona Name]

**THINKS** (internal thoughts, beliefs, concerns)
- What occupies their mind regarding this problem?
- What worries them?
- What assumptions do they hold?
- What do they aspire to?

**FEELS** (emotions, emotional drivers)
- What frustrates them?
- What excites or motivates them?
- What fears do they have?
- What gives them confidence?

**SAYS** (verbalized statements, language used)
- How do they describe the problem to others?
- What do they complain about?
- What do they ask for explicitly?
- What language/jargon do they use?

**DOES** (observable actions, behaviors)
- What steps do they take today?
- What workarounds do they use?
- How do they interact with existing tools?
- What do they avoid doing (and why)?
```

**Empathy map quality checklist:**
- Contradictions between quadrants are noted (says one thing, does another)
- Emotional drivers are identified, not just surface-level feelings
- Observable behaviors are grounded in real research or validated assumptions
- Language captures their vocabulary, not the PM's vocabulary

## Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

Capture the jobs users are hiring a solution to do:

```markdown
### Job Statement Format
"When I [situation/context], I want to [motivation/force], so I can [desired outcome]."

### Functional Jobs (practical tasks to accomplish)
1. [Job statement]
   - Current solution:
   - Satisfaction level (1-5):
   - Frequency:

### Emotional Jobs (how they want to feel)
1. [Job statement]
   - Current emotional state:
   - Desired emotional state:

### Social Jobs (how they want to be perceived)
1. [Job statement]
   - Current perception:
   - Desired perception:

### Related Jobs (adjacent tasks in the workflow)
1. [Job statement]
   - Relationship to core job:
```

**JTBD quality checklist:**
- Jobs are solution-agnostic (describe the need, not a feature)
- Jobs include context/situation triggers
- Functional, emotional, and social dimensions are covered
- Jobs are prioritized by importance and current satisfaction gap
- Over-served jobs identified (don't compete here)
- Under-served jobs identified (opportunity space)

## Current-State User Journey Map

```markdown
### Journey: [Task/Goal Name]

| Stage | Actions | Touchpoints | Thoughts | Emotions | Pain Points | Opportunities |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| [Trigger/Awareness] | | | | | | |
| [Research/Evaluation] | | | | | | |
| [Decision/Action] | | | | | | |
| [Usage/Execution] | | | | | | |
| [Follow-up/Reflection] | | | | | | |

**Critical moments of truth:**
1. [Moment where experience succeeds or fails]

**Biggest drop-off points:**
1. [Where users abandon or get stuck]

**Emotional peaks and valleys:**
- Peak: [Highest positive moment]
- Valley: [Lowest negative moment]
```

**Journey map quality checklist:**
- Covers the full end-to-end experience, not just the product interaction
- Includes emotional arc, not just functional steps
- Pain points are specific and observable
- Opportunities are linked to specific journey stages
- Multiple personas may have different journeys for the same goal
