# Value Hypothesis Reference

## Value Hypothesis Statement

### If/Then/Because Format
```markdown
**If** we [provide this capability/solution]
**Then** [target persona] will [adopt/change behavior in this way]
**Because** [underlying reason/insight this addresses their need]

**Measured by:** [Primary metric that proves/disproves this hypothesis]
**Timeframe:** [When we expect to see signal]
**Confidence level:** High / Medium / Low (with rationale)
```

Generate 1-3 value hypotheses. Each should be:
- Testable with a clear true/false outcome
- Tied to a specific persona and need
- Falsifiable within a reasonable timeframe
- Connected to the problem statement

## Riskiest Assumptions

Identify assumptions that, if wrong, invalidate the entire hypothesis:

```markdown
### Assumption Stack

| # | Assumption | Category | Risk Level | Evidence For | Evidence Against | Test Method |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | | Desirability / Viability / Feasibility / Usability | Critical / High / Medium / Low | | | |

**Categories:**
- **Desirability**: Users actually want this / will use it
- **Viability**: The business can sustain this / it generates value
- **Feasibility**: We can build and deliver this
- **Usability**: Users can figure out how to use it

### Leap-of-Faith Assumptions (rank by risk)
1. [Most critical assumption — if this is wrong, nothing else matters]
2. [Second most critical]
3. [Third most critical]

### Recommended Validation Approach
For each leap-of-faith assumption:
- **Assumption:** [Statement]
- **Cheapest test:** [Lowest-cost way to validate]
- **Signal to look for:** [What would confirm or deny]
- **Kill criterion:** [What result would make us stop]
```

## Value Proposition Canvas

```markdown
### Customer Profile (Right Side)

**Customer Jobs:**
- [Functional jobs — tasks they're trying to accomplish]
- [Emotional jobs — how they want to feel]
- [Social jobs — how they want to be perceived]

**Pains:**
- [Undesired outcomes, obstacles, risks they want to avoid]
- Severity ranking (1-5) for each

**Gains:**
- [Outcomes and benefits they desire]
- [Required gains vs. expected gains vs. unexpected gains]

---

### Value Map (Left Side)

**Products & Services:**
- [What we offer that helps them get the job done]

**Pain Relievers:**
- [How our offering alleviates specific pains]
- Maps to pain: [Reference]

**Gain Creators:**
- [How our offering creates specific gains]
- Maps to gain: [Reference]

---

### Fit Assessment
- **Problem-Solution Fit:** [Do our pain relievers/gain creators address the most important jobs, pains, and gains?]
- **Gaps:** [Customer needs not addressed by our value map]
- **Over-service:** [Value map items that don't map to real customer needs]
```

## Success Metrics & KPIs

```markdown
### North Star Metric
- **Metric:** [Single metric that best captures the value delivered]
- **Why this metric:** [How it connects to both user value and business value]
- **Current baseline:** [Current state, if known]
- **Target:** [Goal, with timeframe]

### Leading Indicators (predict future success)
| Metric | Description | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| | | | |

### Lagging Indicators (confirm past success)
| Metric | Description | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| | | | |

### Counter-Metrics (ensure we're not gaming the system)
| Metric | Description | Threshold | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| | | | |

### Measurement Plan
- **Data sources:** [Where metrics come from]
- **Instrumentation needed:** [What tracking must be built]
- **Reporting cadence:** [How often metrics are reviewed]
- **Decision framework:** [How metrics inform go/no-go decisions]
```

## MVP Scope Recommendation

```markdown
### Minimum Viable Test
Based on the riskiest assumptions, the minimum viable test to validate the value hypothesis:

**What to build/do:**
- [Smallest thing that tests the hypothesis]

**What NOT to build:**
- [Explicitly excluded from first iteration]

**Success criteria:**
- [Quantitative signal that confirms the hypothesis]
- [Qualitative signal to look for]

**Timeline recommendation:**
- [Suggested timeframe for the test]
```
